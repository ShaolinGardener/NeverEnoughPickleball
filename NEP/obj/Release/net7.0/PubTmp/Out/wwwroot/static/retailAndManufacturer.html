        <h2>Help us grow the great sport of <span style="color:#ff6801">Pickleball!</span></h2>
        <p>
            We at <strong>Never Enough Pickleball&reg;</strong>, a 501c3 Nonprofit, are a community advocate charity - inspired by the social aspects of pickleball.  
            We believe in proactively making a difference in youth development & opportunity, along with the surrounding community.  Although our main focus is 
            on encouraging a healthy support system to youths through athletic 
            endeavors, we believe that, in the case of many extant kindred programs, an avenue of further guided development would be beneficial once someone has "aged out." 
            We hope to offer a solution to this participatory gap by developing a robust, community-supported group athletic experience.

        </p>
        <p>
            The positive effects of sports on a youth’s life, in terms of physical and mental health, are well-documented; but so, too, is the truth that a very low percentage of 
            athletes will turn an early passion for athletics into a sport-related career.  However, the advantages of maintaining these endeavors recreationally may continue to produce returns  
            during the transition to adulthood, and evince interdisciplinary benefits as they begin to dive into their chosen career paths.  This is why we are committed to a 
            two-pronged approach of both assisting or creating youth programs, and expanding stability and access to the pickleball community platform.

        </p>       
        <p>
            Your assistance, along with monetary contributions provided by the community, would help us close that expense gap for youth programs.  We understand paddles are the first
            things someone would think about when they hear of a pickleball charity; but high need areas, where we'd like to have the most effect, have apparel & shoes related
            items in shortage as well.  Additionally, getting someone comfortable in their own skin may be the first, and most important, hurdle to overcome.  Of course,
            we would be extremely grateful with any offerings of assistance, and we hope to realize continued mutually beneficial relationships with our contributors and the
            recipients of this and other great causes.
        </p>
        <p>
            We would very much like to have a conversation with any and all who may want to be involved, in whatever their chosen capacity.  Please visit our website to view our 
            mission & programs; and become a member to learn more as we are developing a host of more detailed information, plans and benefits to being part of this good cause. Below
            you will find our available contributory tiers for both community and corporate partners. While any contribution is appreciated, it is through more substantial partnerships
            that we can most expeditiously turn this dream into a reality.
