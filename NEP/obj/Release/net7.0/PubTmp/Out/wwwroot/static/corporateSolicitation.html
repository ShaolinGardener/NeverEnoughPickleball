        <h2>Help us grow the great sport of <span style="color:#ff6801">Pickleball!</span></h2>
        <p>
            We at <strong>Never Enough Pickleball&reg;</strong>, a 501c3 Nonprofit, are a community advocate charity - inspired by the social aspects of pickleball.
            We believe in proactively making a difference in youth development & opportunity, along with the surrounding community.  Although our main focus is
            on encouraging a healthy support system to youths through athletic
            endeavors, we believe that, in the case of many extant kindred programs, an avenue of further guided development would be beneficial once someone has "aged out."
            We hope to offer a solution to this participatory gap by developing a robust, community-supported group athletic experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            The positive effects of sports on a youth’s life, in terms of physical and mental health, are well-documented; but so, too, is the truth that a very low percentage of
            athletes will turn an early passion for athletics into a sport-related career.  However, the advantages of maintaining these endeavors recreationally may continue to produce returns
            during the transition to adulthood, and evince interdisciplinary benefits as they begin to dive into their chosen career paths.  This is why we are committed to a
            two-pronged approach of both assisting or creating youth programs, and expanding stability and access to the pickleball community platform.
        </p>       
        <p>
            Your donation aids in paying for program and equipment expenses for these individuals, as well as investing in updating and/or creating more community-accessible pickleball courts
            for greater opportunity of involvement.  The low-entry costs associated with playing pickleball, and our potential negotiated cost savings with manuafacturers and retailers, will
            enable us to maximize the impact of your charitable contribution. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Having the support of such a well-respected and recognized brand would garner more attention to our mission and reaffirm to consumers that your company is one of charity and community stewardship.  
            Our goal is to become a recognizable nationwide community advocate, and your strong support would aid us in realizing that aim.
            Below you will find our available contributory tiers for both community and corporate partners. While any contribution is appreciated, it is through more substantial partnerships
            that we can most expeditiously turn this dream into a reality.
            <br />

        </p>
        <p>
            We have plans for events and youth programs, in coordination with notable professionals and other pickleball associations, the details of which are still in development, 
            that would require and advertise your sponsorship.  These endeavors will provide an opportunity for us to engage further with your brand to ensure proper alignment and implementation of products 
            and platforms.
